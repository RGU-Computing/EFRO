# 🎓 EFRO: Education Funding Regulations Ontology

EFRO is designed to model funding rules, monitoring activities, and evidencing requirements based on the UK Department for Education’s guidance. EFRO addresses the gap in current education ontologies, which lack support for funding compliance. It enables automated reasoning and compliance checking through SPARQL queries. The ontology is evaluated using real-world competency questions and aims to support education providers in managing complex and evolving funding regulations.

## 📘 Description

 EFRO addresses this challenge by formally modelling funding rules, monitoring activities, and documentation requirements in a machine-interpretable OWL format. It supports SPARQL-based compliance checking, policy reasoning, and evidence validation. EFRO enables education providers, auditors, system developers, and researchers to automate rule interpretation, guide funding-related decision-making, and audit institutional data against complex funding conditions, such as early withdrawals, progression, and eligibility constraints, with confidence and transparency.
